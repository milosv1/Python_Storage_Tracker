# Python_Storage_Tracker_Rewritten
As of 10/06/2020 my command line tool allows for command line arguments, for example when you direct yourself to the repository containing the file, simply run the following python s_tracker.py this will allow you to view information such as host name, network info bytes sent/bytes recieved - information on cores, storage info. running the following command python s_tracker.py -h shows what other arguments are available to run, this is essentially the help command. The other arguments available are python s_tracker.py --piechart piechart & python s_tracker.py --barchart barchart both show the data visually.
