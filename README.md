# Py Storage Tracker
Py Storage Tracker is a cross-platform command line tool written in Python 3 to help track storage of your device! This is a project being actively developed by Milos Vuksanovic, over time I will continue to add more features and functionality. Feel free to play around with this project, test it etc :-).
