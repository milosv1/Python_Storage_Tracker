# Python_Storage_Tracker_Rewritten
Python Storage Tracker - This is a new implementation of my other storage scanner which was a simple prototype written without the usage of functions! - now i have renamed this project to properly suit its use! This is now going to be known as the Python_Storage_Tracker (rewritten)! this will be a project that will evolve over time, The current state of the project on 18/05/2020 allows the user to see the amount of storage on total_amount, free_amount & used_amount. it also allows the user to view it in a bar graph and interact with the bars to see their storage values! - This project will evolve over time and ideas!
